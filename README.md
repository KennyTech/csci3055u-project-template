## About the language

> **History**
> - Scala was written by Martin Odersky in 2004 after his experience with working with the Java team and being unsatisfied with the contraints of Java. Odersky wanted a language that was a midway from a language that is as pragmatic as Java, and a language that is a pure functional academic language. At the time he worked on FUNNEL, a functional programming language that yields general programming notation, based on join-calculus theory (concurrent processes, global lexical scoping, static type-checking, and so on).
> 
> **Some interesting features**
> - Scala is an "object functional" programming language.
> - Scala combines functional programming with object orientated programming that is capable of operating with the Java infrastructure.
> - Syntactic flexibility (ie. foo.toString = foo.toString(), semi-colons are unnecessary to end lines)
> - Type inference (ie. Compiler will deduce type when unspecified)
> - Unified type system (ie. Unlike Java where there are strict distinction, any types, like *Int* and *Boolean* both inherit from the *Any* class)

*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```
